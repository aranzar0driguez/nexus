# Nexus - Mental Health Support App

Nexus is a mental health app designed to help individuals connect with others who share similar experiences. The app categorizes users based on their mental health conditions, providing them with a supportive community where they can find understanding, share experiences, and offer encouragement. 

## Features

- **Personalized Categorization**: Users are categorized based on their mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc.). This helps users connect with others who have similar experiences and challenges.
  
- **Community Support**: Nexus provides a platform for users to connect with one another, participate in discussions, and share coping strategies, creating a safe space for individuals to feel heard and understood.

- **Peer Connections**: The app allows users to find and message others in similar categories. This fosters meaningful relationships and provides peer support for mental health challenges.

- **Resources and Tools**: Nexus includes resources, articles, and mental health tips tailored to the needs of each user based on their categorized mental health condition.

- **Privacy and Security**: User privacy is a top priority. Nexus ensures that all interactions are secure, and users' personal information is protected.

- **Expert Guidance**: For users seeking professional help, Nexus offers the option to connect with licensed mental health professionals for counseling and therapy.
